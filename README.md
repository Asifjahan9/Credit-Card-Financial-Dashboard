Credit Card Detailed Analysis using Power BI

🚀 *Project Overview* 
• This project involves creating a Power BI dashboard in four steps: 
1. *Project Overview:* Define the problem and objectives. 
2. *Data Extraction:* Connect Power BI to an SQL Database to import data. 
3. *Data Processing & DAX Queries:* Perform calculations and data processing. 
4. *Dashboard Creation & Insights:* Build dashboards and extract insights. 

🔽 *Data Extraction* 
• Imported credit card transaction data and customer details from the SQL Database. 

💾 *Data Processing* 
• *Cleaning Data:* Remove null values and duplicates. 
• *DAX Queries:* Create calculated columns and measures using DAX, like age groups and income categories with the SWITCH function. 

📊 *Dashboard Creation* 
• Develop two main dashboards: 
1. *Customer Report:* Displays demographics and performance metrics. 
2. *Transaction Report:* Highlights transaction trends and insights. 
• Use visualizations like column charts, tree maps, and demographic filters (e.g., gender, income). 

🔍 *Key Metrics and Insights* 
• *KPIs:* Track revenue, interest rates, transaction volume, and satisfaction scores. 
• *Weekly Reports:* Monitor performance trends over time for better decision-making.

2. *KPIs:* Metrics like satisfaction scores, interest rates, and revenue help assess engagement success. 
3. *Usage Patterns:* Analyze how customers use credit cards (e.g., for bills or education) to guide product strategies. 
4. *Customer Feedback:* Surveys and reviews reveal satisfaction levels and highlight improvement areas. 

*Insights from Customer Analysis* 
• *Demographic Insights:* Identify specific customer types (e.g., self-employed) to customize strategies. 
• *Behavioral Trends:* Track shifts in spending patterns through weekly reports. 
• *Real-Time Insights:* SQL integration enables agile decision-making by reflecting current trends.
